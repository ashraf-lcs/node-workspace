1. Create the project using npx create-next-app@latest

Routing Conventions and rules : 
1. File-based routing system
2. Files inside App directory can be reached through route
3. Sub-directory will serve as route path eg; app/blog/first/page.tsx -> http://localhost:3000/blog/first
4. Route files must be named page.js/page.tsx

** Even if you don't have the layout file created in the app folder root, once theroot route is accessed it will be created by next.js **
