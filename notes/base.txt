1. Create the project using npx create-next-app@latest

Routing Conventions and rules : 
1. File-based routing system
2. Files inside App directory can be reached through route
3. Sub-directory will serve as route path eg; app/blog/first/page.tsx -> http://localhost:3000/blog/first
4. Route files must be named page.js/page.tsx

** Even if you don't have the layout.tsx file created in the app folder root, once theroot route is accessed it will be created by next.js **

Dynamic Routes using path parameter : http://localhost:3000/product/{param}
1. A dynamic path parameter can be represented in folder structure as "[parameter]" name with square bracket.
2. the functional component inside this folder will have access to to the parameter 
    eg; 
        export default async function ProductDetails({ params }: { params: Promise<{ productId: string }> }) {
        const productId = (await params).productId;
        return <h1>Product details for product {productId}</h1>
    }
